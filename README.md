# CrappyWare

> The game is only intended to be played on PC only.

This is my first attempt at making a game in Godot (I've never made a game before, haha). I'm not sure if will be up to
any kind of quality standards but at least I learned a lot in the 2 days I've been working on it lol.

As I was saying, this is **crappy** clone of WarioWare microgames with the theme of *Coins* (per the theme of [Siege](https://siege.hackclub.com)). **BTW**, after 4 rounds the game starts to speed up and speed up and... you know it, speed up.

You can also get lives! You start with 3 lives and have a max of 6.

## the microgames

*wooah*, we got the best of the best microgames over here:

- collect coins randomly scattered around the screen
- do nothing
- open slack and get a coin
- press a button on your keyboard
- sort coins into fake and real (hard)
- spam your spacebar

## how to run

you either:

1. download godot 4.5 and open the project in it and run it
2. go to pre-built web release on [itch.io](https://moonbeeper.itch.io/coinware) and play it
